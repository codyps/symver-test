case 1:
	- symvers on every symbol with multiple versions
	- list a sym in the version-script for each version it changes
	- use different names from the targeted symbol for each defined symbol.

case 2:
	- symvers on old symbols with multiple versions
	- list a sym in the version-script only for the latest version which changed it.
	- list the latest version of the symbol named for the symbol it self

Neither case 1 or 2 produce an unversioned symbol.
